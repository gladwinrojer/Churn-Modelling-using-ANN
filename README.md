# Churn Modelling

  This is a Simple Churn Prediction Model on a bank customers who are likely to leave the bank.
The csv file contains the last 6 month information of over 10000 bank customers.
The column 'Exited' has values either 0 or 1, which simply means the customer stayed or the customer left the bank.
I have used Artificial Neural Networks for this problem and was able to achieve accuracy of 83% (Without any parameter tuning).
